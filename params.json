JSerializeReader is going to reverse the process so it will instantiate an object with fields initialized with data based on stored JSON information translated by JModel class.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEADLINE 5 JUNE 2013\r\n\r\n\r\n_This github repository is public just because we are students and its free so dont bother to contribute._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
